# Chess_AI
Trying to create an AI that will play chess (not an engine) and delve into AI technology.

Now project are freezed. Mechanically it's work good (maybe some artifacts with displaying in C#_WPF), but directly AI component work bad.
Network has 3 layer:
1. Figure value from another figures on board
2. Figure value from own position
3. Final value on board 
I use reinforcement learning and there are problems with position evaluation.

If in any way anyone who knows AI technology gets here, I'd love to get some advice on this topic. 
Of course, advice on git code and design is also appreciated.
